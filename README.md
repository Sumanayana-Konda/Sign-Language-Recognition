# Sign-Language-Recognition

## Overview
Developed a sign language recognition system using Mediapipe that recognizes all signs in less than 2 seconds.
## Dataset
Trained and tested the model using a dataset of 12904 sign images of alphabets and numbers as train data and 12874 as test data
## Preprocessing
Performed extensive preprocessing on the sign language dataset, including resizing and normalizing the images to improve the model's accuracy.
## Model Selection
Conducted research to identify the best machine learning model to use for sign language recognition, ultimately choosing Mediapipe for its advanced features and flexibility.
## Performance Metrics
 Implemented optimization techniques such as data augmentation and regularization to improve the model's performance.Achieved high accuracy, precision, and recall metrics for the model by carefully evaluating and optimizing it.
## Impact
 Designed the project with the goal of improving communication and accessibility for people with hearing disabilities, showcasing your ability to think beyond technical details and consider the potential real-world impact of your work.
## Future Works
Identified potential areas for future work, such as incorporating additional sign language gestures, improving the model's accuracy on noisy or low-quality images, and exploring the use of deep learning techniques.
